        <p>Conclusion: The way Bartleby was treated may not change but he could have had a more successful story if he had todays help with mental illnesses.</p>
        <h2>Paper</h2>
        <p>“Bartleby the Scrivener”, by Herman Melville tells the story of a strange man who is hired at a law office in New York as a scrivener, however he turns out to be a little bit different than one might expect. Bartleby is a very odd, quiet man that used to work at a dead letter office but becomes a great worker at the law office putting out work at a very pleasing rate. On the other hand, one day comes by that Bartleby is passed a job to scribe however he replies that he doesn’t want to do it which astonishes the boss of the office. Time goes by of Bartleby’s continued defiance and eventually he is let go from the office however he continues to linger around the office forcing him to be arrested and imprisoned where he dies in the prison yard (Melville 622-648). One might conclude that Bartleby could be suffering from some variation or variations of mental illness however his story might have been different in today's time. Mental illnesses have been an ongoing issue over a long period of time, but the way patients are treated and the degree of care they get could have possibly changed overtime affecting the story of Bartleby if it were played in today's time period.</p>
        <p>In “Bartleby the Scrivener”, one may notice that Bartleby was most likely suffering for some rendition of a mental illness due to his strange and quiet behavior as well as his defiant mannerisms that made him a hinderance to society in the story. In the story, Bartleby was not treated well by his coworkers Ginger Nut and Turkey however they did not see the inner struggle that was taking place inside the mind of Bartleby. Many people don’t fully understand the struggle of mental illness and just translate that ignorance into insult. “Public stigma refers to a set of negative attitudes and beliefs that motivate individuals to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illness” (Parcesepe & Cabassa 1). The stereotypes surrounding mental illness add a negative connotation to the issue ultimately resulting in the way Bartleby is treated in the story. Studies show that people with mental illnesses are looked upon negatively and ultimately result in distancing themselves from people with mental illnesses (Parcesepe & Cabassa 6). The lawyer that Bartleby works for is quite patient with his quirks giving him multiple chances at his tasks however his coworkers often mock him and treat hm poorly acting as if they are out to get him (Melville). Ginger Nut even refers to Bartleby as “a little luny” due to his odd behavior (630). Although it is unclear what Bartleby is suffering from, it is quite noticeable that he has some sort of mental illness that affects his daily life however he cannot control it. For years, mental illnesses have been a part of society evolving over the years on the other hand it appears in most cases that the way these people are view by the general public have remained negative.</p>
        <p>One of the most prominent modern advances surrounding mental illness that could have helped Bartleby is clinical diagnosis. His continued use of the phrase “I would prefer not to” began to frustrate people to the point of his unemployment (Melville). Today however, there are many more diagnosis and treatment methods that could have benefited Bartleby not only in the workplac3e but also his daily life. Bartleby was a diligent worker however that began to deteriorate overtime as he was assigned more jobs coining the infamous phrase “I would prefer not to” (Melville 628-629).  Nowadays there are ways to diagnose and treat mental illnesses to improve patient's daily life. The steps of diagnosis begin with a physical test to display any physical issues followed by a lab test to check your inner vitals for abnormalities or substance use, and finally a psychological examination to talk with someone about your inner thoughts and feelings to answer any questions about your condition (Mayo Clinic Staff 1). Had Bartleby been in today's century instead of 1853, he may have been able to receive the help he needed in order to succeed and keep his job. Bartleby was often quiet and only spoke when he was required to answer, he rarely ate a meal or used the restroom and in fact was discovered to be living in the office after the discovery of his bedding and toiletries (Melville 634-635). These odd behaviors began to raise suspicion to his boss ultimately resulting in Bartleby being let go from his job (638-639). If Bartleby’s peculiar behavior and mannerisms could have been properly reported and later identified he could have received proper treatment that could have helped him keep his job and avoid being imprisoned and resulting in his death (648). Mental illnesses are a serious issue affecting mass amounts of today's society so the need for diagnosis is very important to ensure these patients can be properly treated back to a healthy mental state.</p>
        <p>The most important piece in attending to a mental illness is the process of treatment to help the patient overcome their struggles. In Bartleby, the Scrivener”, the issue of mental illness is shown through Bartleby and his daily struggle to operate in the workplace. Instead of receiving proper treatment, his issue is ignored, and he is treated poorly because of it. According to the Mental Illness Policy Org, around 50% of people with severe mental illnesses are going untreated ("50% of Mentally Iill Untreated" 1). There are multiple ways a mental illness can be treated however there are some that work better in certain situations than others. One of the methods to treat a mental illness is different types of medication which works well in conjunction with other methods of treatment however will not cure the illness solely by itself (Mayo Clinic Staff 5). Another road on the path of treatment in called Psychotherapy, or talk therapy in which you talk out your issues with a therapist in order to better understand what is causing these issues and ultimately develop multiple ways to cope with your thoughts, feelings, etc. (Mayo Clinic Staff 6). Furthermore, in Herman Melville’s short story, these methods and techniques of treatment quite possibly could have greatly benefitted Bartleby in the outcome of the plot. One may conclude had Bartleby been properly diagnosed, he could have possibly received treatment to help him cope with his mental struggles and result in him avoiding being fired and becoming a successful worker in the law office. Also, depending on the circumstances of his employers' guidelines, he may even receive the care on behalf of his works insurance benefit. The use of therapy in parallel to medication has been known to create a successful combination and if this knowledge had been known in the time the Melville’s story takes place, the ending may have a different outcome in Bartleby’s favor.</p>
        <p>The theme of mental illness is very easily noticeable to anyone who reads “Bartleby the Scrivener” however the issue in the time of the story varies greatly to if the story took place in the time period of today. The story of Bartleby although depressing, could vary greatly if the modern advances in the field of mental illnesses of this time were available at the time Melville’s short story is set. Bartleby may have seemed like an abnormally weird character with all his quirks, mannerisms, and behaviors that gave him the reputation of an incompetent worker that says, “I would prefer not to”. Even though people are still treated poorly for their mental illness, now there are plenty of resources to diagnose these problems and work in many different ways to attempt to lessen the severity of said illness and ultimately make it easier to live a normal life coping with a mental illness. Melville’s story highlights the themes of mental illness and shows the lack of knowledge of the issue during that time while describing Bartleby’s life working at a law firm where he becomes quiet and defiant resulting in his termination. Mental illnesses have been an ongoing issue over a long period of time, but the way patients are treated and the degree of care they get could have possibly changed overtime affecting the story of Bartleby if it were played in today's time period. The story of “Bartleby the Scrivener” by Herman Melville may appear to explain the struggle and negativity of the character’s life however reflecting on today's knowledge of society may prevent Bartleby from becoming just another “dead letter”.</p>
